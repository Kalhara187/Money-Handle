# TODO: Enhance Backend with Security and AI Features

## Information Gathered
- Backend has basic Express setup with auth, user routes, and middleware.
- AIChatBot component exists in frontend with financial calculation features.
- Current security includes helmet, rate limiting, CORS, and JWT auth.
- Need to add enhanced security, logging, input sanitization, and AI endpoints.

## Plan
- Enhance server.js with additional secure headers and middleware.
- Add logging middleware for request tracking.
- Implement input sanitization in routes.
- Create new AI routes for chatbot functionality (e.g., message processing, financial calculations).
- Update middleware for better security.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- backend/server.js
- backend/routes/auth.js
- backend/routes/user.js
- backend/middleware/auth.js
- New: backend/routes/ai.js
- New: backend/middleware/logging.js

## Followup Steps
- Test backend endpoints with Postman or similar.
- Integrate AI routes with frontend AIChatBot component.
- Run security audit on updated backend.
- Deploy and monitor for issues.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add enhanced security headers to server.js (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Create logging middleware (backend/middleware/logging.js)
- [ ] Add input sanitization to auth and user routes
- [ ] Create AI routes (backend/routes/ai.js) for chatbot functionality
- [ ] Update server.js to include new middleware and routes
- [ ] Test all endpoints for security and functionality
- [ ] Update frontend to use new AI endpoints if needed
